# Mastermind_challenge
Mastermind is a board-game, where the user have to guess by using the logic where and which color are 4 balls of random combination are.

## Development
This was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Nothing was imported. Everything is working with attributes for draggable items and ids to change colors.

### Why?
We wanted to build this challenge using HTML, CSS and JS because we wanted to improve in our Web Development skills.

## Using
You will must to guess which combination of 4 balls of 8 colors existing is the right combination in order to be a Master Mind.
Drag the balls from the right panel to the center panel, each time you press 'Check' your combination will be tested with the secret combination.

In the left panel you will see sometimes some colors, white ball means you guessed the color of a ball but not the position, color red means you guessed position and color of a ball. (the left panel don't tell you which ball you guessed, you will need to guess it too, the left panel balls colors are not in order!)

If you get the correct position of all balls, you will see an alert with some congratulations and in the bottom panel you will unlock the secret combination.

If you lose by using all your tries, you will see an alert with some sad message saying you are not a master mind, and you will unlock the secret combination too.
